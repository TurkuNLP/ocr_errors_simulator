Your car ride back from the theater won't be a quiet one, but sometimes it's good to have a sugary treat."" Dave McGinn of The Globe and Mail gave the film two out of four stars, saying ""Unfortunately, the film promises more fun and laughs than it delivers, and this meal tastes like too many that have gone before it.""

During the compaction process, if the loading pressure is increasing straightly, the powder assembly will experience three stages. First of all, particles are filling the voids and set up contacts with the adjacent particles. This stage is termed rearrangement stage. After most contacts are set up, the initial compaction started. Elastic deformation and plastic deformation happens and the loading pressure increases sharply.

"Most sharks are ""cold-blooded"" or, more precisely, poikilothermic, meaning that their internal body temperature matches that of their ambient environment. Members of the family Lamnidae (such as the shortfin mako shark and the great white shark) are homeothermic and maintain a higher body temperature than the surrounding water. In these sharks, a strip of aerobic red muscle located near the center of the body generates the heat, which the body retains via a countercurrent exchange mechanism by a system of blood vessels called the rete mirabile (""miraculous net""). The common thresher and bigeye thresher sharks have a similar mechanism for maintaining an elevated body temperature.","Mt6t shBrks a\e ""cold-blooded"" orB more p[cis>ly, poik8lothermic, meanin$ 7h2 Eheir i3nt]rnal bodly thmpwryruMe matche5 that on their ambient emvironMent.

"The Merriam's wild turkey ranges through the Rocky Mountains and the neighboring prairies of Wyoming, Montana and South Dakota, as well as much of the high mesa country of New Mexico, Arizona, southern Utah and The Navajo Nation, with number from 334,460 to 344,460 birds. The subspecies has also been introduced into Oregon. The initial releases of Merriam's turkeys in 1961 resulted in establishing a remnant population of Merriam's turkeys along the east-slope of Mt. Hood and natural immigration of turkeys from Idaho has established Merriam's flocks along the eastern border of Oregon. Merriam's wild turkeys live in ponderosa pine and mountainous regions.

"Between 1898 and 1903, during his scientific travel across America, Hrdlička became the first scientist to spot and document the theory of human colonization of the American continent from east Asia, which he claimed was only some 3,000 years ago. He argued that the Indians migrated across the Bering Strait from Asia, supporting this theory with detailed field research of skeletal remains as well as studies of the people in Mongolia, Tibet, Siberia, Alaska, and Aleutian Islands. The findings backed up the argument which later contributed to the theory of global origin of human species that was awarded by the Thomas Henry Huxley Award in 1927.","B|tweena 198 and 1903, during dio sc#ientific travel? across 5merica, HodviZk> became the fiist?s*ientistLto spot and 5o]ument1 th& theowy ofkhumFan co2onEzation of th$,6merican Vlontinent froX eastpAsia, wh2ch 0ejwaimed ^as nl7 soxe 3,000 years ag!. 2eJargued that the Indians migiY/ed aYross the nering StgaFit rom Asia, \u portingI this theo^y wi}h deI#iled f7{eldA0esearchof skeletal rema0ns as we4l aS studius of the people e' Mongo2ia, bibet,Sieria Alaska, and Aleutian)IKlavds.

"The ESAS proposal was originally said to be achievable using only existing NASA funding, without significant cuts to NASA's other programs, however, it soon became apparent that much more money was needed. Supporters of Constellation saw this as a justification for terminating the Shuttle program as soon as possible, and NASA implemented a plan to terminate support for both Shuttle and ISS in 2010. This was about 10 years earlier than planned for both programs, so must be considered a significant cut. This resulted in strong objections from the international partners that the US was not meeting its commitments, and concerns in Congress that the investment in ISS would be wasted.","CThe dSS pr&posal was origiXalKy said@ tGo5be an8ieva}BM'using only existing xASA fundingL withfAt significant cuts to sASA's o=her proFUam&, hv|ever, iS soon,becamy opp:cent hat uch m3re Pomeykas nedeY.

"In 2002, Zito became one of the best pitchers in baseball. On June 22, Zito won his 10th game of the season. It was the earliest that an A's pitcher had reached the 10-win mark since Bob Welch got there on June 15, 1990. Zito was named to the All-Star team for the first time in his career. On July 18, he went 7.1 innings while giving up no runs against the Angels. That win gave Zito a team-record 16th straight win at home. Zito again faced the Angels in his next start and produced similar results. He went 6.1 innings and gave up just one run. That win gave Zito the most wins by an AL pitcher (14).

Additionally, around the 1850s, the Faroe Islands started to develop their own national identity, and so many Faroese Americans may not have identified closely with Scandinavian Americans that they would feel the need to live amongst them.","6ere is evidence th t Fhro9sehAmeri?.ns Ae4,Ee$widely across t?1 Unit`d States, a8d Gid not refine th[Vselves to simplyvth aras+setled by4many Scandina*ianAmeri4Vns.

"The first pulp mill along Tistaelva was Søndre Skåningsfossen Træsliberi, established by Christian Anker in 1867. This operated profitably and was able to capitalize on much of the otherwise low-value refuse from the sawmills. Saugsbrugforeningen started considering the possibility of building its own pulp mill in 1872. Declining pulp prices from 1874 caused the company to shelve the plans for the meantime. The mechanical pulp mill opened in 1889 with five grinders and annual production of 11,000 tonnes, employing sixty people. The pulp mill was the company's until then largest investment, financed through a loan of 1.25 million Norwegian krone.","The fTrst pulp Oill along Tistaelva was Cøndre Skåningsfossen T&æsliberi, e4tabli|hVed by Chpistian AnkEe  in 1867.

"In such a system, any person can encrypt a message using the intended receiver's public key, but that encrypted message can only be decrypted with the receiver's private key. This allows, for instance, a server program to generate a cryptographic key intended for a suitable symmetric-key cryptography, then to use a client's openly-shared public key to encrypt that newly generated symmetric key. The server can then send this encrypted symmetric key over an insecure channel to the client; only the client can decrypt it using the client's private key (which pairs with the public key used by the server to encrypt the message). With the client and server both having the same symmetric key, they can safely use symmetric key encryption (likely much faster) to communicate over otherwise-insecure","InxuchVa sysgemi any pGrs%on d2n eL>yE{ a mesa3l us_ng Lhe iten^d receivH ']pmbli* key, buttYa?r encr9ted essag= Kan only be&djc4ypQeI w<h the receive'F p42vate ;ey\ZChisallos, fo2 unDQancR,pa6s*rver progr_m to bene<pDe a+crrpMograapYic k8y <deded fO/ a P3itable sygmebricikeyscrypJogr4phy, Rheu to use a GlieGt's openly-sharedupzblic key no e(crypf*xha*t neQwi ge0e7azedGsymetri k6eyl Thx srve caI3thnJRn"" t5is\RWcrypted sWmme!rMr kty ovtr1anAinsacuOe""c~aJ!el to tPe v(-8en>; ony thejvlientg yWn dxcry4t it us:ngJtihe clieJt'spri<;te key (whAich {airs wi$ thexppbbic |ty ""se  byrthe serve to ensry}t the meT{pge).\With tIe clien""]Fnd se3v^r]b7th haXing *the sWTm` s_mmetric keywhGhMy can saf?^y wune sy(mCt~ic `ey en@ryptWaon (l$kely uchbfaster Uttco5m\nic'te""ovjer qtherwis--inseuPEe","In sucha syftemany pErson can enc'yp-t · -message Using the inTe~ndedreeive'f punPYc k.ee,· buatthatencryfpted messrage can only e derypted with the receiver's_ private&key. trhis  llws,e fo'r i~nsta1nce, a sehver PCrOgr~am to geznejrate ' cryptograpic key intended fror a suitnable ίeyfmetr1c-kvey. cryptgra-phy,thed to ie salclien'rs oenly-thred ublic eyto encryFpttat newxy. g:enerated frymrmt ic~ k y. he server, canl then senÊ this encr-pe sy,me1hic key ovr an; arnsecure channel to) tHe client; ony t&e cient can defdfpi~git ulsin te clieht's lprivate key (¹hdchpai·rf With he pubti-c~ ke usfea by the erVetr' -t'o. encrypt te mssage .-~ ÑAe client and ser-ver both haiivg te s~ame symmet~ic ke]y,r they can zafely πuse symmetRickey encryption ~(likely much fas-ter to cH-municiate o erdbotheρrwlise-insecure"

"The Music Machine was an American rock band formed in Los Angeles, California in 1966. Fronted by chief songwriter and lead vocalist Sean Bonniwell, the band cultivated a characteristically dark and rebellious image reflected in an untamed musical approach. Sometimes it made use of distorted guitar lines and hallucinogenic organ parts, punctuated by Bonniwell's distinctively throaty vocals. Although they managed to attain national chart success only briefly with two singles, the Music Machine is today considered by many critics to be one of the groundbreaking acts of the 1960s. Their style is now recognized as a pioneering force in proto-punk; yet within a relatively short period of time, they began to employ more complex lyrical and instrumental arrangements that went beyond the typical garage band format.","The Music Machine was an American rock band formed in Los Angeles, California in 1966.

"When Masuda returned, she caught a cold and was bedridden with a high fever. Her old lover, Motoyama, had returned to nearby Suwa and had become a city councilor; when he heard that she had returned, he sought her out and found her a place to live. Despite the fact that Motoyama had married and had a child, they began to see each other regularly. Around this time, Masuda learned to read hiragana and kept a diary of their encounters. However, when elections for city council came near, at the urging of Motoyama's wife, Masuda left him to improve his chances of being reelected.","WXenc Masuda returned, she RauWhtI a cNld a:d w6s beCdrisde` with a hig6 fever.

"In addition to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Ælla is also mentioned in Scandinavian sources, such as the Norse sagas. According to the latter, Ælla captured the semi-legendary Swedish-Danish Viking leader Ragnar Lodbrok and put him to death in a pit of snakes. The historical invasion of Northumbria in 866 occurred in retaliation for Ragnar's execution, according to Ragnarssona þáttr (The Tale of Ragnar's Sons). While Norse sources claim that Ragnar's sons tortured Ælla to death by the method of the blood eagle, Anglo-Saxon accounts maintain that he died in battle at York on 21 March 867.

"The other major problem with working with the fighter escorts was linking up when the weather over England was often poor. This was made all the worse because for the daylight raids the bomber groups formed up and crossed the channel under the German radar, which meant they were down under 200 feet. The ability to find other aircraft flying at such a low height was very limited. Pelly solved this by advising Fighter Command that his Bostons would make the planned rendezvous on the correct heading and at the precise time, give or take 15 seconds.

"By the 1960s, Italian horror films such as Black Sabbath were more violent, sexualized and downbeat than the horror films created in America. American International Pictures focused on a youth-oriented audience whereas horror in Europe was intended for adults. This led to the American edit removing plot elements of prostitution and lesbianism and making the most altered of Bava's films on its English-language version.

"Because manatees evolved in habitats without natural predators, they lack predator avoidance behavior. The large size and low metabolic rates of manatees lends to their capacity for long and deep dives, as well as their relative lack of speed. Manatees are frequently solitary creatures, but they do aggregate at warm-water habitats during the winter and during the formation of breeding herds. In spite of their docile demeanor, due to their large size the West Indian manatee has nearly no natural predators in its native environment. American alligators and American crocodiles have been suspected to on occasion take a manatee. A dying manatee was discovered in Puerto Rico, wounded by a large shark bite thought to be inflicted by either a tiger shark or bull shark.

"During the revolution of 1917–1918, Doroshenko held several responsible positions under the radical and socialist Ukrainian Central Rada, which quickly emerged as a kind of Ukrainian national parliament, and he helped to build the autonomous Ukrainian People's Republic. However, distressed by the continuous shift to the left of the Central Rada, Doroshenko supported the conservative coup staged by General Pavlo Skoropadsky and his German military supporters and was named Foreign Minister in the new Hetmanate, or monarchy, that was then established. He was a firm supporter of the Ukrainian national element in this regime to which many ""White"" Russian elements were attracted, but he also had the difficult task of reconciling various pro-Russian, pro-German, and pro-Ukrainian influences on the foreign policy of the Hetmanate.

"In many classifications, the Crambidae have been treated as a subfamily of the Pyralidae or snout-moths. The principal difference is a structure in the ears called the praecinctorium, which joins two tympanic membranes in the Crambidae, and is absent from the Pyralidae. It would seem to be a matter of personal opinion (therefore not susceptible to definitive decision) whether this distinction merits division into two families, or whether the common presence of ventrally-located ears should unify them into one family. The latest review by Munroe & Solis, in Kristensen (1999) retains the Crambidae as a full family.","rn Hany classificatmons, t>e [ra&bPdae Tave beZ! ereated=as a subVxmitlQy oh the PyvnaI:da 2x sno't-moths.

"On the morning of Christmas Eve the trap has worked, but instead of a wolf, there is a naked old man trapped in it. Even though Pietari was grounded for playing a trick with his father for using reindeer traps in the fireplace, he has been full of fear of the approaching Christmas, like an animal sensing a more powerful beast in its territory. He sneaks out of his father's house to a police truck, with his disappointed father in hot pursuit. They reach a village, where Rauno hears from other villagers that potato sacks, heaters, and Aimo's wife's hair-dryer, have gone missing. Pietari enters Aimo's house, and finds that Aimo's son Juuso is gone, with a straw effigy in his place.","On the morning of Christmas Eve the trap has worked, but instead of a wolf, there is a naked old man trapped in it.

"The Ilgachuz Range began erupting 6.1 million years ago and has grown steadily since then.

The upwelling of the hot magma creates volcanoes, and each individual volcano erupts for a few million years before the movement of the plate carries it away from the rising magma.
