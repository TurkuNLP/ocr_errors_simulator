"The Merriam's wild turkey ranges through the Rocky Mountains and the neighboring prairies of Wyoming, Montana and South Dakota, as well as much of the high mesa country of New Mexico, Arizona, southern Utah and The Navajo Nation, with number from 334,460 to 344,460 birds. The subspecies has also been introduced into Oregon. The initial releases of Merriam's turkeys in 1961 resulted in establishing a remnant population of Merriam's turkeys along the east-slope of Mt. Hood and natural immigration of turkeys from Idaho has established Merriam's flocks along the eastern border of Oregon. Merriam's wild turkeys live in ponderosa pine and mountainous regions.

"Between 1898 and 1903, during his scientific travel across America, Hrdlička became the first scientist to spot and document the theory of human colonization of the American continent from east Asia, which he claimed was only some 3,000 years ago. He argued that the Indians migrated across the Bering Strait from Asia, supporting this theory with detailed field research of skeletal remains as well as studies of the people in Mongolia, Tibet, Siberia, Alaska, and Aleutian Islands. The findings backed up the argument which later contributed to the theory of global origin of human species that was awarded by the Thomas Henry Huxley Award in 1927.","B|tweena 198 and 1903, during dio sc#ientific travel? across 5merica, HodviZk> became the fiist?s*ientistLto spot and 5o]ument1 th& theowy ofkhumFan co2onEzation of th$,6merican Vlontinent froX eastpAsia, wh2ch 0ejwaimed ^as nl7 soxe 3,000 years ag!. 2eJargued that the Indians migiY/ed aYross the nering StgaFit rom Asia, \u portingI this theo^y wi}h deI#iled f7{eldA0esearchof skeletal rema0ns as we4l aS studius of the people e' Mongo2ia, bibet,Sieria Alaska, and Aleutian)IKlavds.

"The ESAS proposal was originally said to be achievable using only existing NASA funding, without significant cuts to NASA's other programs, however, it soon became apparent that much more money was needed. Supporters of Constellation saw this as a justification for terminating the Shuttle program as soon as possible, and NASA implemented a plan to terminate support for both Shuttle and ISS in 2010.

"The Music Machine was an American rock band formed in Los Angeles, California in 1966. Fronted by chief songwriter and lead vocalist Sean Bonniwell, the band cultivated a characteristically dark and rebellious image reflected in an untamed musical approach. Sometimes it made use of distorted guitar lines and hallucinogenic organ parts, punctuated by Bonniwell's distinctively throaty vocals. Although they managed to attain national chart success only briefly with two singles, the Music Machine is today considered by many critics to be one of the groundbreaking acts of the 1960s. Their style is now recognized as a pioneering force in proto-punk; yet within a relatively short period of time, they began to employ more complex lyrical and instrumental arrangements that went beyond the typical garage band format.","The Music Machine was an American rock band formed in Los Angeles, California in 1966.

"The other major problem with working with the fighter escorts was linking up when the weather over England was often poor. This was made all the worse because for the daylight raids the bomber groups formed up and crossed the channel under the German radar, which meant they were down under 200 feet. The ability to find other aircraft flying at such a low height was very limited. Pelly solved this by advising Fighter Command that his Bostons would make the planned rendezvous on the correct heading and at the precise time, give or take 15 seconds. This required Pelly's navigator, Jock Cairns, to be on the mark every time, and he never missed a trick. Pelly soon developed a close working relationship with his fighter escorts.

"Prof. Osuji retired voluntarily from Imo State University in 1990 to pursue a career in politics. In 1991, he emerged as the Imo State Governorship candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) with an unprecedented landslide victory. An enormously popular candidate, Osuji was heavily favored to win the governorship election ahead of the late Senator Evan Enwerem of the National Republican Convention. However, with a few days to the elections, the Federal Government of Nigeria, under General Ibrahim Babangida, inexplicably disqualified Osuji along with former Vice President Atiku Abubakar and other leading gubernatorial candidates in several states.

American International Pictures focused on a youth-oriented audience whereas horror in Europe was intended for adults. This led to the American edit removing plot elements of prostitution and lesbianism and making the most altered of Bava's films on its English-language version.

"In many classifications, the Crambidae have been treated as a subfamily of the Pyralidae or snout-moths. The principal difference is a structure in the ears called the praecinctorium, which joins two tympanic membranes in the Crambidae, and is absent from the Pyralidae. It would seem to be a matter of personal opinion (therefore not susceptible to definitive decision) whether this distinction merits division into two families, or whether the common presence of ventrally-located ears should unify them into one family. The latest review by Munroe & Solis, in Kristensen (1999) retains the Crambidae as a full family.","rn Hany classificatmons, t>e [ra&bPdae Tave beZ! ereated=as a subVxmitlQy oh the PyvnaI:da 2x sno't-moths.

"In 2010 Scanella and Jack Horner, Scannella's mentor at Montana State University, published research on the growth patterns in thirty-eight skull specimens (twenty-nine of Triceratops, nine of Torosaurus) from the Hell Creek formation. They concluded that Torosaurus indeed represents the mature form of Triceratops. Horner stressed that the frill of ceratopsian skulls consisted of metaplastic bone. A characteristic of metaplastic bone is that it can lengthen and shorten over time, extending and resorbing to form new shapes. Significant development is seen even in those skulls already identified as Triceratops, Horner observed, ""where the horn orientation is backwards in juveniles and forward in adults"".

"The Ilgachuz Range began erupting 6.1 million years ago and has grown steadily since then. Like all of the Anahim volcanoes, the Ilgachuz Range has its origins in the Anahim hotspot—a plume of magma rising from the Earth's mantle in central British Columbia. The hotspot remains in a fixed position, while the North American Plate drifts over it at a rate of 2 to 3.3 centimetres per year. The upwelling of the hot magma creates volcanoes, and each individual volcano erupts for a few million years before the movement of the plate carries it away from the rising magma. However, where hotspots occur under continental crust, basaltic magma is trapped in the less dense continental crust, which is heated and melts to form rhyolites.

"Erected by the Byzantines as Tzympe, Çimpe Castle was traditionally held to have fallen in a moonlight attack to Suleyman Pasha and 39 of his chosen guard in 1356. However, modern scholarship holds that it was granted to the Ottoman Turks by the Byzantine emperor John Kantakouzenos around 1352 for their use during his war against his erstwhile charge and co-emperor John Palaiologos. A major earthquake in 1354 then permitted Suleyman's forces to move from Çimpe to the far more important stronghold of Kallipolis (Gallipoli, modern Gelibolu), which they quickly rebuilt and fortified.","Erected b  he Byzfotines as Tzympe, Çimpe Castle,w~M traditionally held to have fallenZin a{moonlight attack to Sulqyman Pasha and 39 of his chosKn)guard in 1356.tHowever, modern scnolarship holds thpt it was granted to the Ottoman Tur}s by th0 Byzantine emperr John Kantakouzenos around 1352 for their8use during his wr against his erstwhile charge and coL-emperor Aohn Pa,aiologop.

"Lambda diodes work at higher voltage than tunnel diodes. Whereas a typical tunnel diode may exhibit negative differential resistance approximately between 70 mV and 350 mV, this region occurs approximately between 1.5 V and 6 V in a lambda diode due to the higher pinch-off voltages of typical JFET devices. A lambda diode therefore cannot replace a tunnel diode directly.","Tambda diodes work at Wigh|rhvoltXBe than tunnel diodes.

The Ganda Harla is an abandoned settlement located 12.5 km southeast of Harar on a hill west of the village of Sofi and is linked with the Harla in local tradition. The zooarchaeological data indicated the inhabitants were hunters of wild animals in open terrain and scrub hillsides with the exception of Kobus kob which are more commonly found at lower elevations such as in valleys and riverine grasslands. The locals also kept domesticated animals such cattle (Bos taurus/indicus), goat (Capra hircus), sheep, and transport livestock such as donkey, horse and camel.
